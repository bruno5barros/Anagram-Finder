# Anagram-Finder
Program to find anagram

Hello,

I hope you are well.

To run my solution, you will need an IDE or run python on the command line.
The following command allows you to run the solution:
- python anagram_finder.py

After running the command you will have to provide a filename to validate the
exitance of anagrams. You have to provide the filename without the filename
extension.
The following files are provided:
- anagram.txt
- anagram1.txt
- anagram2.txt
- anagram3.txt
- anagram4.txt

By following these instructions you are able to watch the final result.

Thank you for the opportunity, looking forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards,
Bruno Barros
